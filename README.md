This is our machine model that predicts trends within different historical data sets and uses those trends to predict future cases of the trends. 
In this case the model is taking into account the linear regression
and continuing it, for the current data it shows that the trend will keep going down thus becoming a negative imapct within the Navajo water crisis. 
Our same model predicts postive outcomes and shows what the maximum 
consumption is within the given times: 10 and 5 years.
