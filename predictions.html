                    To ensure sustainable water resources for future generations in the Navajo region, several
                    water-saving
                    practices can be adopted. These include implementing efficient irrigation systems for agriculture,
                    using
                    drip irrigation to
                    minimize water waste, and encouraging rainwater harvesting for local use. Upgrading infrastructure
                    to reduce
                    water
                    leakage and improving water storage capabilities are also essential. Public education on water
                    conservation,
                    along with
                    community-led initiatives, can further enhance water-saving efforts. By combining modern technology
                    with
                    traditional knowledge, the Navajo Nation can build a more resilient and sustainable water future.

        <p class="heading">How the Model Works</p>
        <p class="text">The model leverages historical water data, including storage, inflow, and release volumes, to
            predict future trends. Through linear regression, the model forecasts when water storage levels may reach
            critically low points, if sustainability measures are not implemented. By analyzing patterns over the past
            60 years, the predictions help guide future decisions regarding water management for the Navajo Nation.</p>
