        <p class="text">Water scarcity is a significant issue in the Navajo Nation, a region spanning Arizona, Utah, and
            New Mexico. Many Navajo residents lack access to clean, running water due to a combination of geographic
            isolation, underdeveloped
            infrastructure, and historical neglect. More than 30% of the population lives without piped water, often
            relying on
            water hauling from distant sources. Droughts, contamination from mining, and depletion of groundwater have
            worsened the problem. Efforts are being made to address these challenges through infrastructure development,
            federal funding, and tribal initiatives, but the issue remains critical for the health and well-being of the
            community.</p>

                which provided us with historical water data from 2006-2024. Key parameters we viewed were inflow, outflow, evaporation,
                 and storage. Due to missing values, duplicates and incosistent entries the data needed to be cleaned and preprocessed.
                 After that we looked for trends amongst the parameters that were generated by the model.

        <p class="heading">How the Model Works</p>
        <p class="text">The model leverages historical water data, including storage, inflow, and release volumes, to predict future trends. Through linear regression, the model forecasts when water storage levels may reach critically low points, if sustainability measures are not implemented. By analyzing patterns over the past 60 years, the predictions help guide future decisions regarding water management for the Navajo Nation.</p>

        <p class="text">
            To ensure sustainable water resources for future generations in the Navajo region, several water-saving
            practices can be adopted. These include implementing efficient irrigation systems for agriculture, using
            drip irrigation to
            minimize water waste, and encouraging rainwater harvesting for local use. Upgrading infrastructure to reduce
            water
            leakage and improving water storage capabilities are also essential. Public education on water conservation,
            along with
            community-led initiatives, can further enhance water-saving efforts. By combining modern technology with
            traditional knowledge, the Navajo Nation can build a more resilient and sustainable water future.
