        <p class="text">Water scarcity is a significant issue in the Navajo Nation, a region spanning Arizona, Utah, and
            New Mexico. Many Navajo residents lack access to clean, running water due to a combination of geographic
            isolation, underdeveloped
            infrastructure, and historical neglect. More than 30% of the population lives without piped water, often
            relying on
            water hauling from distant sources. Droughts, contamination from mining, and depletion of groundwater have
            worsened the problem. Efforts are being made to address these challenges through infrastructure development,
            federal funding, and tribal initiatives, but the issue remains critical for the health and well-being of the
            community.</p>

                The data we used for our model is sourced from the

                    website</a>
                which provided us with historical water data from 2006-2024. Key parameters we viewed were inflow,
                outflow, evaporation,
                and storage. Due to missing values, duplicates and incosistent entries the data needed to be cleaned
                and preprocessed.
                After that we looked for trends amongst the parameters that were generated by the model.

                    This graph illustrates the relationship between the net flow volume and net storage volume of the
                    Navajo Reservoir over
                    time. The net flow volume represents the gross amount of water entering and exiting the reservoir,
                    while the net storage
                    volume reflects the total water stored at the end of that particular date. By analyzing these trends
                    together, we can
                    better understand the reservoir's water dynamics and project the point at which the storage might
                    reach critically low
                    levels.

        <p class="text">
            To ensure sustainable water resources for future generations in the Navajo region, several water-saving
            practices can be adopted. These include implementing efficient irrigation systems for agriculture, using
            drip irrigation to
            minimize water waste, and encouraging rainwater harvesting for local use. Upgrading infrastructure to reduce
            water
            leakage and improving water storage capabilities are also essential. Public education on water conservation,
            along with
            community-led initiatives, can further enhance water-saving efforts. By combining modern technology with
            traditional knowledge, the Navajo Nation can build a more resilient and sustainable water future.
