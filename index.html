        <p class="text">Water scarcity is a significant issue in the Navajo Nation, a region spanning Arizona, Utah, and
            New Mexico. Many Navajo residents lack access to clean, running water due to a combination of geographic
            isolation, underdeveloped
            infrastructure, and historical neglect. More than 30% of the population lives without piped water, often
            relying on
            water hauling from distant sources. Droughts, contamination from mining, and depletion of groundwater have
            worsened the problem. Efforts are being made to address these challenges through infrastructure development,
            federal funding, and tribal initiatives, but the issue remains critical for the health and well-being of the
            community.</p>

        <p class="heading">About the Project</p>
        <p class="text">Our project leverages open-source datasets from 2006 to 2024 to analyze annual water levels in
            the Navajo Nation. This
            historical analysis is crucial for training our machine learning model, which uses key features like water
            influx and
            release. After training, the model predicts water levels for the next five years, factoring in current water
            consumption
            rates. We visualize these predictions using the Pandas library for clear, data-driven insights. Our model
            assumes that
            water release directly correlates with consumption, providing a basis for understanding future water
            availability trends
            in the region.

                We are utilizing a dataset from the Navajo Reservoir Government website, which contains essential
                features for our project. Dataset can be found <a
                    href="https://www.usbr.gov/uc/water/hydrodata/reservoir_data/920/dashboard.html">here</a>
                The first step in our data pipeline involves cleaning the dataset by removing duplicates, handling
                missing values, and ensuring data consistency. Once the dataset is refined, we apply supervised learning
                techniques to train our model. Specifically, we experiment with three models each for accuracy:

                <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">After identifying the most accurate model,
                we visualize the predictions by plotting a graph between water levels and years using the Pandas
                library.
                These predictions are based on current water inflow and consumption trends, providing insight into
                future water
                availability.</p>

        <p class="text">
            To ensure sustainable water resources for future generations in the Navajo region, several water-saving
            practices can be adopted. These include implementing efficient irrigation systems for agriculture, using
            drip irrigation to
            minimize water waste, and encouraging rainwater harvesting for local use. Upgrading infrastructure to reduce
            water
            leakage and improving water storage capabilities are also essential. Public education on water conservation,
            along with
            community-led initiatives, can further enhance water-saving efforts. By combining modern technology with
            traditional knowledge, the Navajo Nation can build a more resilient and sustainable water future.
